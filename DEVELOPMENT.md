Install and test
----------------
To prepare the project you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Version 8.2 or above should be fine (mostly because using `padEnd`; see [Node compatibility chart](https://node.green/))

Now that you have node install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

To check if it work run tests:
```
npm test
```

Running a local copy
--------------------
Note to use a development version of gulp-monkeyscript in your script install it as a folder. So use something like:
```
npm install ..\..\gulp-monkeyscript\ 
```

This will allow you to run with your modification before pushing them back to Github.
