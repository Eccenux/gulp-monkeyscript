To prepare the project you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Version 8.2 or above should be fine (mostly because using `padEnd`; see [Node compatibility chart](https://node.green/))

Now that you have node install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

To check if it work run tests:
```
npm test
```
